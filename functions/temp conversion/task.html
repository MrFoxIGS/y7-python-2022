<h1>Functions within Functions</h1>
<p>In python we can call functions within other functions. In
the code on line 17 the function to_kelvin is called within the
temp_convert function. We do this to make functions shorter and
easier to understand. We try to break our problem up so
that each function does one job.</p>
<h2>Converting between Temperatures</h2>
<p>In Australia we use the unit degrees celsius to measure temperature.
<br>In the US they use a different unit degrees fahrenheit<br>
Phyists use the unit Kelvin to measure temperature. </p>
<p>To convert from celsius (C) to fahrenheit (F) we use:<br>
F = (C x 9/5)+32</p>
<p>To convert from celsius (C) to Kelvin (K) we use:<br>
K = C + 273.15</p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>The overall task is to finish creating the function temp_convert
that takes a temperature in degrees celsius and converts to kelvin
    or fahrenheit given by the parameter type</p>
<p>To do this you will need to first finish creating the functions
to_kelvin and to_fahrenheit</p>
